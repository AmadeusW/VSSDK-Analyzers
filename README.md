This project is meant to provide a set of Roslyn Analyzers that makes it easy to catch, discover and implement a wide array of best practices when building Visual Studio extensions.

Check out our [exhaustive list of analyzers](doc/index.md) defined in this project.

If you have an idea for a rule that would constitute a best practice for extension authors to follow, please open an issue with the description.
